They fundamentally change how organizations process payments. Traditionally, companies collect payment orders, create batch files, and release those files to a payments provider using an established process and according to a fixed schedule. In contrast, on-demand payments can be individually initiated, triggered by an event or request. This enables the payment to be embedded into an end-user&rsquo;s experience. In this article, Thomas Swenson and Katie Hoskins from Citi&rsquo;s Domestic and Cross-Border Payments Product Commercialization team explain out how clients can benefit, what type of use cases are best suited for on-demand payments and how this can deliver tangible value to businesses.&nbsp;

		https://www.citigroup.com/global/insights/commercial-bank/healthcare-ipos-treasurys-role-before-the-bell	Healthcare IPOs: Treasury's Role Before the Bell	Life Sciences companies are unique not only in how quickly they scale, but also how early they go public in their life cycle. Listing on a stock exchange is usually a momentous milestone for a business, and for months leading up to it, attention understandably turns almost exclusively to the IPO process, investor roadshows, and ringing the opening bell. What often gets overlooked is the importance of an automated, efficient treasury setup. Getting this right not only delivers a major boost for a healthcare company’s operations in general, but in many cases is necessary to meet the increased expectations and scrutiny that comes with being a public entity.

		https://www.citigroup.com/global/insights/leadership/good-things-happen-e1-social-mobility-breaking-barriers	Good Things Happen, E1: Social Mobility - Breaking Barriers	Talent is everywhere, but all too often opportunity isn't. The futures of far too many young people are determined by background, not potential. Evidence shows that people born into low-income families do not have access to the same opportunities as those born into privilege, regardless of their skills or hard work. Andrew Pitt, Citi&rsquo;s Global Head of Insights joins the podcast to talk about the bank&rsquo;s efforts to help people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds access and climb the career ladder. He explains why a socially diverse workforce makes business sense and the evidenced impact it can have on wider society and GDP. Joining him is Tokunbo Ajasa-Oluwa, CEO of Career Ready, which connects talented young people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to a spectrum of different industries and employers, through summer internships. He describes his interns as &lsquo;pioneers&rsquo; and reveals the barriers they are overcoming, as they pave the way for future generations. Sophie Hulm, CEO of Progress Together, joins to talk about the importance of collaboration among UK financial services. She explains how data collection is an essential cornerstone for companies to measure mobility. And how diversity of experience and innovation in leadership leads to sound decision making.

		https://www.citigroup.com/global/insights/citigps/technology-at-work-v6-0	Technology at Work v6.0	In this new GPS report, Technology at Work v6.0, the team looks at how digital acceleration during the pandemic could drive a shift in the economy from post-industrial to post-production due to increased automation and offshoring risk for the services sector, similar to what’s already happened in the manufacturing sector. We argue that governments and policymakers need to boost innovation and new job creation to offset production tasks that are offshored and automated away. The focus should be on skills that foster innovation and exploration to drive employment in areas focusing on the early stages of the technology lifecycle.
