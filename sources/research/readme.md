This is to capture links for articles on financial topics and assist with research.
As part of this, I will include links to different sites to show the topics covered in the site maps. Amound media sites, I have posted urls from the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com) and the [Economist](https://www.economist.com) for subscribers. I have also added url lists of topics on investment bank websites.

There are different use cases but matching a topic in investment bank research with a topic in a media site can give a different perspective. Creating a mosaic of information involves comparing articles on the same topic.
