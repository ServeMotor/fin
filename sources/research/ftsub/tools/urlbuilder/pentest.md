The [scan was performed](https://pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/find-subdomains-of-domain?view_report=true) using this website, www.pentest-tools.com. The hostnames and ip addresses can be incorrect, deleted, not working, so this is just a guide for possible content. To check whether the externally-accesible or public URLs are still active, users can put them in a spreadsheet.
