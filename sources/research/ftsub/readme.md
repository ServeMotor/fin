## Overview

This section on the FT and its website is to provide some tools on presenting the data, links and content available to digital subscribers to the FT. In many cases, this just means repurposing the links to content in text files, spreadsheets or other formats for users who would find that useful.

Some initial goals

- Use metadata to show snippets of contents and titles
- Use sub-domains and partner content to be easily found
- Understand the file system and organization of the FT website
