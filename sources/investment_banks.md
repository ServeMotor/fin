## Investment Banks

"[An investment bank is a financial services company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp#citation-1) that acts as an intermediary in large and complex financial transactions. An investment bank is usually involved when a startup company prepares for its launch of an initial public offering (IPO) and when a corporation merges with a competitor. It also has a role as a broker or financial adviser for large institutional clients such as pension funds." (From [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com))
