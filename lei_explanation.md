# legal Entity Identifier

[What is the LEI?](from https://www.financialresearch.gov/data/legal-entity-identifier-faqs/)

"The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a reference code — like a bar code — used across markets and jurisdictions to uniquely identify a legally distinct entity that engages in a financial transaction. The LEI is designed to be a linchpin for financial data — the first global and unique entity identifier enabling risk managers and regulators to identify parties to financial transactions instantly and precisely. A large international bank, for example, may have an LEI identifying the parent entity plus an LEI for each of its legal entities that buy or sell stocks, bonds, swaps, or engage in other financial market transactions.""
